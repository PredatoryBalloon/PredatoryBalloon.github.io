				> Advantage Of Slow Falling Before Going Up
				<br><br>
				<div class="section4">
				 In some hard wingless levels, you will be required to gripfly up, fall down, and then gripfly back up again (For example, cp 2 of 'Ninja 2' by Backgrounds', but there are others). While you are falling down, you of course want to counteract the speed of the fall with grip so that when you start gripflying back up, you don't have to fight all that extra speed. But, while doing this, you may notice that you can let go of grip, and while you will fall faster, you will regain some boost. What balance of boost regaining to speed reduction is optimal though for getting the most height out of the second stage of gripflying back up?<br><br>
				 Well, to answer this, I've found that using grip for speed reduction is way way way more beneficial toward getting height out of that last upward movement than regaining boost by letting go of grip, to the point where you would only want to regain boost by letting go of grip if you would still have time to lower the car's downward speed to its minimum possible value once you started to grip to slow down again. In other words, you only want to let go of grip if you still have time to grip again and slow yourself down as much as you possibly can. The amount of time or distance it will take before you want to start slowing down though will vary with how far down the fall is and how fast you were going down when you started the fall and a whole lot of other factors, but if you are unsure, just slow falling the whole way will probably work so long as the map isn't super precise. The amount of possible boost you could even regain is so small, trying to get an advantage out of it might be more difficult than not trying to at all.<br><br>

				 Of course, if you are trying to speedrun a hard map that has this obstacle for some ungodly reason, the advantage of falling becomes its speed, but that is a whole different can of worms.<br><br>
