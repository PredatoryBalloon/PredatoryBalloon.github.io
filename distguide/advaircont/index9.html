				> Vertical Gripfly Interaction With Force Zone
				<br><br>
				<div class="section4">
				 This is very specific, but also very important, I think. What I am referring to here is when you are dealing with a force zone that pushes you in a vertical direction (up or down) and doing vertical gripfly through it (and by vertical, I mean like, nearly straight up or down). This includes both cases where you are trying to use vertical gripfly to assist your speed in the same vertical direction the force zone is pushing in (the end of 'Impact' by Antiglow for example), and the cases where you are trying to use vertical gripfly to assist your speed in the opposite vertical direction the force zone is pushing in (trying to fight against the direction of the force zone essentially; 'Es' by Backgrounds' is the primary example here.). What I want to point out here is that, in both cases, vertical gripfly is actually a less efficient method of movement compared to just boosting in the same vertical direction.<br><br>
				 From what I understand, this is because the motion of vertical gripfly requires putting your car at a particular angle, and this angle, when combined with the whole aerodynamical effect of force zones (covered in the last section on 'Air Drift'), makes it harder for the car to move vertically. By contrast, pointing your car in the direction of the force zone (vertically) seems to result in the best ease of movement, and in the case where the force zone is pushing you in the direction you are moving in, the force zone seems to actually launch you farther and faster when you do this. Force zones are weird in this game.<br><br>
