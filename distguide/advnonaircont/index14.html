				> Car Angle When Going Off A Surface
				<br><br>
				<div class="section4">
				 When you drive off a surface, the angle the car takes is determined by many things: what angle you went off the surface, how fast your were moving, if you started turning just as you went off, if you started braking just as you went off, if you got off by jumping or not. The whole dichotomy and nature of how these factors influence the angle the car takes is all around pretty complicated, but I will do my best to at least address what I consider the most common cases in which knowing these things would be relevant (I should say "most common" since it is not common at all for this to be relevant in the first place). Naturally, most of these cases, I imagine, would only ever have uses in circumstances without thrusters and wings, since if you have either one, slight differences in how you go off a surface are usually negligible, since you can just use either thrusters and wings to reangle your car to however you want. But first, before getting into the most common cases, I want to mention the effect of braking just as you go off a surface, since it has a very consistent, and very useful effect.<br><br>
 				 When you brake just before you go off a surface, whether you jump off or drive off, your car will immediately start to angle its nose toward the direction the surface was in when you got off of it. If you were driving on a regular, flat straight road (as in the bottom of the road points down toward the direction of gravity) and you braked just as you drove off the edge of it, your car would angle to point downwards. Similarly If you are driving on a straight, upsidedown road (as in the non-driveable side of the road points directly away from the direction of gravity) for example, and you decided to brake just before driving off the edge of it, your car would then angle upward.<br><br>
				 Now to the most common cases.<br><br>
				 The first most common case is when you are going up a wall, with thrusters and wings disabled, and you want your car to angle forward after going off the wall so that it can land on top of the wall or over it. <br><br>

				 If you drive slowly off, you will actually probably tip more so that the car faces away from the wall than forward. If you want to tip forward so that you can go over the wall an on/over it, going fast tilts the car forward even more so that it can do that. Even better, if you brake just before you drive off the edge, you will tip forward a lot more. Jumping off is not really what you want to do, as it will probably just lead you away from the wall entirely. You can make it work by braking just before you jump off, which will tilt the car enough forward so you can boostfly over the wall, but that only works if you have boost and it isn't even faster or easier even if you did have boost.
				 The second most common case is if you want to glide after riding on a ceiling without thrusters and without wings (but with boost).<br><br>
				<img style="height:270px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="aaaa_1.jpg"><br><br>

				 Here, all you need to do is brake just as you drive off the edge of the ceiling. This will point your car upward, so that boost points downward, and you can essentially float with boost over to where ever.<br><br>
				 Those are the two main ones. 'NWOT' by Jacsn is a good level to test these out, but there isn't many cases where you should find them applicable. There is one special case I haven't covered, which is how to go off a wall in such a way that you move away from the wall and float. What makes it special is that its one where brake doesn't really help, since it points you toward the wall. It's complicated though and also not even relevant to any level so I'll forgo putting it here for now.<br><br>
