		</div>
		<span id = "peterspan">
	There is an inspector in a house. Today she has figured out how to make ice out of dirt, except, she has run out of dirt. Not really though, she could just go outside and get more.
It is inspector Sicily Lado, and she works for an inspection company that is right down the road from her house. She makes a modest living, but not a whole lot since not many things need to be inspected nowadays. She figured she might have been able to make more money if she took some of her stuff and made something cool, like ice from dirt. It wasn’t actually that cool though, aside from the context in which it functions as a pun.
	She would sell the ice, that is, if she knew how to sell things. She knows how to inspect things, but that is about as far as her skills go to her knowledge. She ponders going outside to smell some ice, but there isn’t any ice outside to smell! What an idiot. We all realize that she would have to put the ice outside first.
	Sicily, who is now so done with loitering around in this house, decides to walk out through the front door. It is a sunny day today, with lots of bees in the sky. She likes this season mostly because it means she get discounts on honey. There is a pathway leading from the front door down to a river. For no good particular reason, she decides that the best course of action right now is to jump in the river, simply because she don’t have anything better to do right now. Normally not having anything to do would never happen, but I guess there have to be exceptions now and then. In a fit of creativity, Sicily realizes that she could probably sell any fish she catches in this river to the local market. In an effort to increase the income she earns through this completely sound plan, she attempts to catch a Spot Bellied Ravitsnar that she sees swimming by. She doesn’t know much about fish, but her limited knowledge tells her that those should be pretty valuable. As she attempts to grab hold of it though, it jumps out of the water and turns into a Fiscch! Sicily doesn’t know what that means though, and she also doesn’t know enough about fish in general to tell if anything about this is unexpected.
	Feeling a sudden burst of fright, she tries to run, but instead going anywhere she is pulled by the river’s current closer to the Fiscch! I don’t know why she even tried that. The Fiscch remains just floating in the air and looking sort of menacing. Now though, looking for anything to neutralize what she thinks may be a threat, she resolves to start throwing anything she has on her at it.  She thinks to throw her precious knife at it first but she quickly realizes she doesn’t have it! She doesn’t know where she left her precious knife last. She presumes to have left in an ice block somewhere. The current continues to push her toward the Fiscch. Sicily then, in a panic, decides throw all her clothes at the Fiscch, knowing that she at least has those on her. She doesn’t get very far though before she collides with a rock in the river, knocking her into a tumble. Nice try though!
	Realizing that she probably can’t destroy the Fiscch before she reaches it at this point, saves herself by grabbing a hold of a root of a tree jutting out into the river. It is strong enough to hold her weight against the current. Her pants slip off though, having been loosened before by her attempt to declothe, and now having been pulled off by the sheer force of current. It heads toward the Fiscch. She is thankful that she lives nowhere near other people, otherwise this entire situation would be pretty embarrassing. 
	After climbing out of the river, she first attempts to asess her location, only to realize she doesn’t have to. It is clear that she only moved about 60 meters riverwise from her house. She can tell, because she can see her house 60 meters away. At least now she is out of the river. She’s going to have to change out of these wet clothes! She briefly considers swimming back up the river to get back to her house, but if there’s one thing she has learned, it is that she shouldn’t go swimming in the river willy nilly. Hey were did the Fiscch go? She tries to look around for where the Fiscch might have went. She is not sure how she lost track of it. She swears it was just there. She doesn’t see her pants either, but they probably just floated down the river. It is highly unlikely that they would be of any significance anyways regardless of where they went, other than the fact that she would like to have them. She then tries to walk back to her house, but at this point she almost wishes she didn’t get out of the river when she did, because now she is on the wrong side! She cannot fathom how she could ever cross back, at least, not without a blue frying pan. She also can’t locate her blue frying pan because she doesn’t own a blue frying pan! And she is pretty sure the only way to get one is by doing a blue frying pan dance, which she also doesn’t know how to do. 
	Still soaking wet, she tries to find somewhere to dry off, and maybe get new clothes. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of shelter like areas out here where she lives. Most of the land is covered in flat grassy hills, with some tree houses here and there. She can make out her company building in the distance, but it sure is a long way away.
	She considers for a moment taking up one of the tree houses as shelter, as she clearly isn’t getting home anytime soon, but the notion strikes her as foolhardy. She has heard that trees are dangerous monsters, so in the interest of her own safety, she decides to NOT go barging into one of there homes. She then considers maybe sitting under the tree she used to get out of the river, but she then quickly berates herself for not paying attention to her own inner monologue. She reaffirms that she is pretty sure trees are dangerous. She only was able to be saved by that one because trees usually sleep pretty hard during the day. She doesn’t want to push her luck though. Thinking back to ways of crossing the river, she thinks maybe she could use her dirt to ice powers to turn the dirt into an ice bridge, but she doesn’t really have dirt to ice “powers”. She just found a machine in her backyard one day and it did exactly that. It is probably still back in the house. She ponders jumping back over the river using a kind of long jump, characteristic of a particular mustached Italian. However, prior experience tells her that trying to do video game kinds of jumps to jump over rivers ends with her in the river, rather than on the other side of it. Wondering if she has anything on her that could be useful, she checks for, well, anything that could be useful. Aside from her clothes, though, all she has is a green marker and a letter from a friend. 
	Curious, she examines the letter. It is a paper letter which was sealed with this acorn sticker before it came undone once it got totally soaked. She could try and read it, but it might be difficult due to the soggy circumstances. 

She tries and to read it anyway.
	
	She first sits down though, next to a rock and tries and retrieve the contents of the letter without tearing it, which is difficult to do because of just how wet it is. However, despite all odds, her apparent latent courier skills pay off and she retrieves it without doing any more damage to the letter’s contents. Nice going! She tries her best to make out the words:

========================================================================
To Sicily,
	How’s it going Sic! I guess I am going to have to make the first gesture of friendship here. Gosh darn it Sic its not that hard to send a letter! Okay, lets get this straightened out. The guy at the theatre just finished a new show. It was alright. Nothing special. But, you want to know some stuff about the TARSNAP? Of course you do alright so it all it does is float in the middle of Nowhereland singing songs, but the songs are actually important, because they dictate what happens on different planets in the squirrel system. The specific ways it changes what events occur are subtle, but important! The olive king of Necon for example, was encouraged to pursue leadership by way of the TARSNAP’s songs. So without the TARSNAP he never would have been king. The TARSNAP, you see, has lived for thousands of years, maybe even more so. Listeners constantly attempt to draw in wisdom from the TARSNAP. These Listeners train for years to try and learn to listen to the TARSNAP’s songs, but if they fail, the songs they hear will steer them away from whatever they are trying to hear. I know I am rambling but you like it when I ramble so  thats how it is going to be. Silly Sicily!

- From Q.P.
========================================================================

	Sicily is entertained, if a little confused, by her friend’s rambling. He always likes to explain to her the complexities of lore surrounding different medias, his favorite undeniably being Cinnasquirrels, which explains the acorn sticker used to seal the envelope and his rambling about the olive king, which, at least from what she has gathered, is the lead arch enemy of the Cinnasquirrels. It all strikes her as a little silly, but nevertheless she finds it kind of interesting to hear about now and again. She thinks he is cool for being into something like that. She never got as invested in lore as he did.
