Let us establish parameters so that we can actually not have a discussion that goes nowhere: The Distacar's "Scenoscope" (eyes) can see what the player camera can see, and can switch between their Scenoscope Modality (camera view). What the Distacar sees as pleasant are things that are comparable to the Average Human Aesthetic, except with an innate fondness towards glowy lights. As the Distacars were initially constructed by Humans, their programming was made to perceive color in the same manner Humans do. That is, rainbows looks the same and every shade of rainbow looks the same as it would to humans. As such, they can not see light outside of what a Human would consider the visible light spectrum. The Scenoscope itself is linked to no physical component of the Distacar, and thus cannot be damaged through blunt force or even through slicing the car into pieces. In the same way, blunt force or slicing does not prohibit the use of the Scenoscope. In reality, the Scenoscope camera itself is actually the Soul of the Distacar, connected to the Distacar’s neural net across dimensions like a phase shifted jellyfish to an unsuspecting Human head, except that the Human brain and the jellyfish work as one. To the Distacars, this is unknown though, and culturally, they suspect it is a part of their machinery that they just haven’t figure out yet. In a way it is, I suppose, but it is not so, I guess, directly accessible as  they imagine. This is getting into the concepts of Life and Death for a Distacar which will be it’s own section, and might explain any confusion you have left about the Scenoscope. Anyways, due to the nature of the Scenoscope, it cannot be blinded by a high intensity light the same way Human eyeballs can be. It can perceive any brightness level without trouble. However, past a certain point, the neural net will have trouble understanding how to work with such large brightness values. As such, prolonged exposure to extremely bright light leads to a breakdown of the neural net (aka not good). The intensity of this light though would need to be more than that from looking at the sun from Earth. 110 000 000 lux is the dangerous amount of luminosity to observe. For perspective, the Sun from Earth is about 126 000 lux, a candle flame from 1 meter away is about 1 lux. A typical flashlight from 1 meter away would be about 65 lux.

The Distacar can “feel” tactile sensations with their Hull. What is often preferable is smooth textures, perhaps also slippery ones, in how slippery is kinda like ultra smooth. Soft textures would be weird sensations to their Hulls, like how Humans probably perceive slimy surfaces. In contrast, rough sensations are less soothing, feeling similar to how Humans don’t like rough sensations (you don’t see sandpaper blankets). Wetness feels normal, perhaps more normal than it is too Humans, since, naturally, they have nothing that stays wet for long (their Bodies are not made of like paper or anything that can get soaked, like Human hair). The Distacar can also feel with their  Rotaloids (tires). The average comfortable and uncomfortable sensations for a Distacar’s Rotaloids are similar to that of their Hull, the only difference is that they really really really dislike soft sensations on their Rotaloids. Cartoonishly so.

As far as heat goes, they can survive hotter temperatures than Humans, but dislike it much more. Distacars actually prefer colder temperatures, much like Humans prefer hotter temperatures when showering. Numerically speaking, they hate temps at and above 94F. Normal temps are around 55F. Cold temps are below 30F.

Can they smell? No. They can not smell, as the Distacar was never built in the first place to smell, nor were there any reason to build in olfactory sensors for completing the Distacars’ First Function.

However, they do eless. The their sense of eless can be described as a general sensation that occurs as a result of the combination of electromagnetic waves that surrounds a Distacar. In this way, they can sense electromagnetic waves outside the visible light spectrum. It is not a directional sense like Human hearing, and it isn’t associated with position like the Human tactile sense. It is, however, experienced similarly to how Humans experience smell. Something can eless nice, or something can eless awful. The common lower limit of Hz a Distacar can eless is 30GHz, however, the lower the frequency, the less intense. There really isn’t an upper limit, other than the limit that is marked by deadly really high frequency waves. The overall eless experience is not so much about the loudest frequency or the highest frequency as it is about the combination over all frequencies. The Eloizer is the part that allows the Distacars to eless. It is integrated into the frame at the nose of the Distacar.

Can they hear? Well of course they can. If they couldn’t, all those announcements during the Adventure campaign would have no use whatsoever. The Auralids are the component that allows a Distacar to hear. It is integrated into the back of the car, visible as two holes, and into the back of the two front Rotaloids, also visible as two holes, but a lot harder to see. These microphones also double as speakers, which allow for sonic communication (communication with sound).

Can the Distacars feel pain? Yes. When bumped a little too hard. When something too hot burns them (though the heat for “too hot” on a single point is considerable, because metal doesn’t burn or melt easily). They don’t experience pain as a result of just being in a sliced state, but the slicing itself hurts like hell. Their noses are the second most sensitive, their tops are the most easiest to injure but are medium sensitivity, and their backs are the least sensitive. Their underside is actually the most sensitive, but it rarely encounters much due to the Rotaloids. The Rotaloids are medium sensitivity.

Can Distacars feel love? Yes. And I’ll do you one better they feel all of the 4 romantic quadrants. Why? Because I said so and it quadruples the shipping possibilities. I’m not going to describe quadrants because its a big thing. Just read up on it. Anyways, the Distacars are essentially genderless. I’m not going into how procreation works right now because that’s outside the scope of my intent right now, but I will say it is common for two (or more) to only procreate if in a red rom. Black roms don’t lead to procreation as much due to the fact that the it would be difficult for the parents to care for the child effectively while in a black rom with one another. Children can logistically be had between as many number of Distacars as there are Distacars, but typically red romances are only between two.

Distacars feel emotions. Regular emotions like hate, fear, sadness, boredness, fun. Nothing here out of the ordinary.

Taste? No. Not really.

Do they get tired on their suspension, of their suspension? What a silly question. Of course not. That makes no sense considering how they are just springs. They do get tired driving and turning a lot though, since they can feel with their tires, and turning requires effort, as does driving forward.

Do they wear clothes? Only for fashion purposes. There is no need for clothes besides fashion, and even then it comes in the form of hats and stickers and things of that nature. Most Distacars though just change their paint job for fashion. Some paint jobs though are designed for extreme conditions like extreme high or low temps or for keeping out water.

Are they fine with resting their Hull on hard surfaces? Not as their preferred choice. It wouldn’t be that uncomfortable, but they don’t like that much pressure and strain against their Hull, and hard surfaces can create that pressure over long periods of time when you have the weight of the entire Distacar pushing down on it. But the Distacar is more resilient than real cars, so it wouldn’t be super uncomfortable, just not preferred for a long time (say like 70mins). The Distacar was designed to rest on it’s Rotaloids, and not really designed to rest on the hull. However, if the Hull is sufficiently strong, then hard surfaces should be fine for resting purposes.

Do they heal after injury? Yes, but not naturally. They have to initiate a healing program to reconstruct the broken parts, which there needs to be a sufficiently strong power source (stronger than the power source the Distacars run on) to run to completion, since energy to matter conversion is not a trivial process. The Distacars can heal themselves if it’s sufficiently small though, like a small dent or scratch, but it can be draining to do too much (which is why resting on the Hull on a hard surface is not really restful; because of the dents and scratches it can cause which the Distacars promptly fix).

Do they need to eat, or do some weird equivalent? They do need power, but most of the time the Distacars actually generate their own power through a generator using a Hyperfine Quantum Mobius. Yes it breaks the second law of Thermodynamics. It can only generate power though when the Distacar is put into Sleep Mode. This is because it takes so much circuitry processing to run the generator, it practically needs all the car’s circuitry to focus on the task of running it for it to generate power. The Distacars can function without going into sleep mode though by taking in electrical energy from an external source, which is pretty easy to do most of the time, but Sleep Mode still remains important to do every 30 hours for a doctor recommended amount of 6 hours in order for the Distacars to not suffer from sleep deprivation, which damages the Distacar’s neural net.

Do Distacars need to sleep? Yes. I just answered  that.

Do Distacars need to keep their wheels (you mean Rotaloids) oiled up, or other parts in good shape? No, they do not need their Rotaloids “oiled up” as they are electromagnetically suspended. Parts need to be kept in good shape, but this is a function of the healing program, so it rarely becomes an issue. However, if a Distacar gets dirty, the healing program will not remedy this dirtyness. Public carwashes help serve this cleaning function. 

Do Distacars need to go to the restroom? What?! No! There is no waste produced by a Hyperfine Quantum Mobius, and all the energy it generates is either stored in a battery or is used! This should all be unbelievably obvious. 

I will also say that Distacars only use boost in emergencies and in boost designated areas. Otherwise, it’s rude and poor etiquette because it is often dangerously fast. The same goes for wings and jump. Thruster usage is fine though, as it Is often important in order to remain stuck to upsidedown roads and walls and such. The Distacar will gladly use all of these though when things get too hot to handle (which is never).

Natural lifespans last around 210 years. Death occurs naturally due to the natural design of the Distacar neural net, as it, from the beginning, was not ever meant to sustain itself for long periods of time. It being a so ingrained in the fundamental design of the Distacar neural net, the issue has eluded solution.

infoBoxDesc = "Okay uhh. Holy shit? What the fuck is this, and why did I write it? Okay, so I THINK what happened was people in the Distance (Distance is a game fyi) discord were discussing how the cars would actually *feel* things and how the cars would function in a society of those cars. I think it started because someone was discussing how to role play in Distance? (Might have been me.) Anyways, clearly I got way too carried away with this shit, and decided to compose a response that was way too long and elaborate. Oh no, oh frick okay I just realized this was back when I first was reading Homestuck. Look at this noob, which I guess I mean me. Thinking they can just jack the 4 rom quadrants into this thing because they are so cool? Doesn't me know that doing that is clearly just the lamest thing, and anyone who knows what's up is going to think I'm an uncreative stooge??? Well, I guess I am an uncreative stooge, so maybe these accusations aren't far from the truth? (They aren't far from the truth.)";
